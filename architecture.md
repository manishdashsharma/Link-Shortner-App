1. User Interface (UI): The UI will consist of a web page or mobile app interface that allows the user to input a long URL and receive a shortened URL in return. The UI can be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web applications or using native mobile app development tools for mobile applications.

2. API Gateway: The API Gateway will serve as a single entry point for all requests made to the link shortener app. It will handle traffic routing and rate limiting to prevent abuse of the service.

3. Backend API: The Backend API will receive the long URL input from the user via the API Gateway and generate a shortened URL. It will use a hashing algorithm such as SHA-256 to generate a unique identifier for the URL and store the original URL, the shortened URL, and the unique identifier in a database. The Backend API can be built using a server-side programming language such as Python, Ruby, or Node.js.

4. Database: The database will store the original URL, the shortened URL, and the unique identifier generated by the hashing algorithm. It can be a NoSQL database such as MongoDB or a SQL database such as MySQL, depending on the specific needs of the application.

5. CDN (Content Delivery Network): The CDN will cache the shortened URLs and serve them to users to improve performance and reduce latency. The CDN can be configured using a service such as Amazon CloudFront or Google Cloud CDN.

6. Security: The link shortener app should implement security measures such as SSL encryption to protect data in transit, input validation to prevent SQL injection attacks, and rate limiting to prevent abuse of the service.
