## LOW Level Design

User Interface (UI)
The UI will consist of a simple web page with a text box for the user to input the long URL they want to shorten, and a button to submit the form. Once the user submits the form, the UI will display the shortened URL that was generated by the app.

Backend API
The backend API will receive the URL from the UI and generate a shortened URL. The API will also be responsible for storing the generated URLs in a database for future reference. Here are the components of the backend API:

Web Server: The web server will receive the URL input from the user via an HTTP POST request.
API Endpoint: The API endpoint will process the request and generate a unique identifier for the URL using a hashing algorithm such as SHA-256. This identifier will be used to create a shortened URL.
Database: The database will store the original URL, the shortened URL, and the unique identifier generated by the hashing algorithm.
URL Generation
To generate a unique identifier for each URL, the API will use a hashing algorithm such as SHA-256. This will ensure that each URL has a unique identifier, and the probability of two URLs generating the same identifier is very low.

Database Schema
The database schema will consist of a single table with the following fields:

ID: A unique identifier for the record.
Original URL: The long URL that was input by the user.
Short URL: The shortened URL that was generated by the app.
Created At: The date and time when the record was created.
API Rate Limiting
To prevent abuse of the service, the API will implement rate limiting. This will limit the number of requests that can be made to the API in a given period of time.

Security
To ensure the security of the link shortener app, it is important to implement security measures such as SSL encryption to protect data in transit, input validation to prevent SQL injection attacks, and rate limiting to prevent abuse of the service.
